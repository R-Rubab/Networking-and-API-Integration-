# Networking and API Integration -----------> Task-4

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
```bash
## Networking and API Integration  
Welcome to Day 4! Today, you'll integrate networking and API calls into your Flutter app:: Add the http package to your pubspec.yaml file and import it.: Implement logic to fetch data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder) and display it in your list.: Modify your provider to include methods for fetching data from the API and updating the list state accordingly.: Implement basic error handling for API calls, showing appropriate messages in the UI.: Display a loading indicator while data is being fetched and update the list with the fetched data once itâ€™s available.
```
This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
